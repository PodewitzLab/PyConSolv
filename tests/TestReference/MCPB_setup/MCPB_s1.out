The following is the input variable you have:
The variable ion_ids is :  [1]
The variable ion_info is :  []
The variable ion_mol2files is :  ['PT.mol2']
The variable original_pdb is :  Full_PDB.pdb
The variable add_bonded_pairs is :  [(1, 10), (1, 11)]
The variable add_redcrd is :  0
The variable additional_resids is :  []
The variable anglefc_avg is :  0
The variable bondfc_avg is :  0
The variable chgfix_resids is :  []
The variable cut_off is :  2.8
The variable force_field is :  ff19SB
The variable frcmod_files is :  ['B.frcmod', 'C.frcmod', 'D.frcmod', 'E.frcmod']
The variable gaff is :  1
The variable group_name is :  LIG
The variable ion_paraset is :  12_6 (Only for the ions using the nonbonded model).
The variable large_opt is :  0
The variable lgmodel_chg is :  -99
The variable lgmodel_spin is :  -99
             -99 means program will assign a charge automatically.
The variable naa_mol2files is :  ['B.mol2', 'C.mol2', 'D.mol2', 'E.mol2']
The variable scale_factor is :  1.0
             ATTENTION: This is the scale factor of frequency. The 
             force constants will be scaled by multiplying the square
             of scale_factor.
The variable smmodel_chg is :  -99
The variable smmodel_spin is :  -99
             -99 means program will assign a charge automatically.
